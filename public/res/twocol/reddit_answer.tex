If you could add any feature to Reddit, what would you add and why?\\

If I could add any feature to Reddit, I would add the ability to .\\

If you were a super villain that could only cause minor inconveniences to people, what would be your superpower?\\

If I were a supervillain that could only cause minor inconveniences to people, I would choose the ability to control the temperature of other people's beverages. Whether it's their coffee, tea, or soup, they will alway miss the optimal temperature to comfortable sip their drink. The first sip will always be hot enough to scald their tongue, ruining their ability to enjoy any accompaniments to their meal. They will then put down their drink to let it cool down for a bit, but when they next remember about it, it will be barely warm and rapidly cooling. Conversely, if they buy a cold drink, it will rapidly approach the unpleasantly lukewarm temperature range.\\

Regards,\\
Ivan Lin
